  <p>The Indian work ecosystem is blowing itself away by using only ET guys.Sooner or later, they are gonna realize what a big mistake it was to only hire the functional elements, leaving behind the Humanities.So, that is what I'm planning on doing.A more dynamic playground for everyone in the roster.Its like people want to go crazy but, the only way they could do it is through "xtra-curriculars".What the fuck does that even mean?.So fuck <strong>curriculars</strong>.Lets just use the Education for the art of expression and the playground to impress or to showoff.</p>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Alpha school - My kindergarden years.My vocabulary was moulded here.Absolutely, no doubt about that.</li>
   <li>St.James school - The ideal childhood years.It is quite fascinating to think about it now.</li>
   <li>SRV school - My worst and the best memories,there's a reason I put the one before the other.</li>
   <li>SVCE college - Not whole. It would lean more on the side of pursuit of happiness all the time.Which per se is a bad thing.</li>
   </ul>
